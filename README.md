# Google-BusinessIntelligence-Projects

1. Project planning documents are generated in order to align with stakeholders. This will allow you to understand the teamâ€™s needs as you begin to develop a BI solution. As a BI professional, you will need to be able to communicate effectively with stakeholders and execute solutions that answer their specific needs. 

2. Your knowledge of SQL and potentially Google Dataflow will be used to combine and move the key datasets you identified for the Google Fiber project into a target table. This represents the extraction phase of an ETL pipeline, when data is pulled from different sources and moved to its destination. You will use the table you create in this activity to develop the final dashboard for stakeholders.
